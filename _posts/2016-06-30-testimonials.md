* Chestertons Kew have now been working alongside both Diederick & Gergana at DE Photography for almost a year. The photographs we receive back from them are absolutely fantastic and great value for money compared to other local photographers. My relationship with both of them is superb. They are flexible, efficient, extremely professional and very easy & pleasant to work with -- I cannot recommend them highly enough and have been referring them over to our other Chestertons offices to get on board!

Thank you both for your continued hard work ensuring our clients properties are placed on the market looking fantastic and with a rapid turnaround time.
